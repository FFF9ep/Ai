Drinks and snacks frequently offered. Overall a no fuss, no bother experience.',\n"," 'Not Verified |  The flight scheduled at 1840 left 2hours 40 minutes alter due to late arrival of incoming aircraft from Naples, as a result I missed a connection from Istanbul to Dubai, Nothing unusual. The issue acknowledged by the captain is that the plane had been late since the morning flight from Rome with rolling effect until the evening. As this was the case, whey did BA not contact me and all other passengers, I could have made other arrangements and fly early to Istanbul and not miss my connection resulting in a £300 charge and a long delay. BA has certainly lots of staff who could have informed by using the email or text. Obviously passengers are of no utility to BA once the ticket is purchased. Who can trust BA to travel? Not me now after such poor handling of a simple matter.',\n"," '✅ Trip Verified |   I have been flying BA for over 15 years. I was an American Airlines FF and gave it up for BA. I am a Gold member on BA and have been for over 10 years. Here are the things I have noticed over the last 5 years on BA. the Flight attendants are getting lazier and complacent, from cleaning bathrooms to serving meals. The food on BA has deteriorated to the point of not being able to eat the garbage they give you and having gold status is almost meaningless in the big scheme of things. I have NEVER been able to upgrade to business or first using the AVIOS points I have accumulated on a transcon flight. I fly BA now because its the only partner of American Airllines that I can easily get to europe. I have switched back to AA FF program and is already so much better. BA used to be a splendid airline and now its just another poor airline in the european market!',\n"," '✅ Trip Verified |   On arriving at Mexico Airport we were told that the flight was delayed because the aircraft had broken down and the replacement aircraft from LHR was about six hours late. When we eventually managed to check in we told that – contrary to the BA website – we could not have access to the 24-hour Grand Lounge Elite and instead would use the American Airlines Admirals Club lounge which would close three hours before the flight left. After that we would have to use a restaurant and were given a food voucher. Two hours before the flight was due to leave were then informed that the aircraft had diverted to Cancun because of a “volcanic ash cloud over Mexico City” – although it did not appear to be affecting other flights into the airport including those from Europe. They eventually arranged taxis to take us to a hotel and we arrived at 1.30am. We were assured that we would all be on a BA flight leaving the same time the following day. The only contact after that was a local employee who stayed at the hotel. He said that he was there to organise transport and refused to give us any other contact details. (When we eventually did need transport the following day he had disappeared.) During the night, we were then sent an email telling us that we were booked onto an Air Canada flight leaving at 6.30am. This would have been impossible with such short notice and without Canadian EPA authorisation. We then spent two hours trying to make contact with BA – its Mexico number did not work and eventually we were put on an Aeromexico flight in economy. They told us to check in as soon as we could but this meant we had to pay an extra £200 for the seats. Later, after a very long call, we were told that we could be upgraded to business with Aeromexico despite having been told earlier that there was no availability. BA then informed us that because we had already checked in – as they had suggested – we could not be moved and this took three more calls to Aeromexico to sort out. I totally understand that aircraft break down but the onus should be on the airline to rearrange and not the passengers. We were lucky because we took the trouble of making the calls to the UK but others – such as a disabled lady – had been told nothing when we left.',\n"," '✅ Trip Verified |   I have flown British Airways for many years and still do so regularly. In one of my last flights this past summer between Paris and Boston, British booked me on a connecting flight between Paris and London that gave me a maximum of 90 minutes to connect in London. London Heathrow is a massive airport where going from terminal to terminal could take 20-30 minutes once you deplane, not including the actual time to deplane if you are seated in the back and lines at passport control and security between terminals. So already, one is pressed for time. My flight from Paris to London that day was tardy, 49 minutes tardy that day to be exact. BA Flight 323 in fact, is routinely tardy. – don’t bother with this one. Flight Connections assisted me by calling the new gate to let them know my previous flight had been delayed and that I was rushing to the gate. It was 30 minutes before my connecting flight was to depart. I ran like a fool for 25 minutes, carryons and all, arriving to the gate 5 minutes before my flight was to depart, only to be greeted by no plane. The agent said that since no one knew where I was (false) the plane left without me – early. Gaining a few minutes was more important than an passenger inconvenienced by their own delay. So I made the 20 minute trek back to Flight Connections knowing that they would have to rebook me the following day. I was now going to miss the wedding I was destined to attend in Boston. They sent me to a prepaid Hilton hotel room for the night but told me that I would have to pay 30 pounds each way for a taxi to take me there. They gave me a pamphlet with instructions for reimbursement. This was in early July. It took me 4 months and a complaint to the British Centre for Effective Dispute Resolution to be reimbursed for the equivalent of $77. There was no apology, no recognition, not even a free drink coupon for that next flight I won’t ever take with British. Like a bad insurance claim, British just kept denying my claim, expecting that I would just go away. Well, I am going away. I’m taking my $77 and using another airline for future travel.',\n"," 'Not Verified | We bought tickets for a Geneva-London flight, but when we got to the airport we were told that the airline had oversold tickets on our flight and that passengers on an earlier cancelled flight had been given seats on our flight. Explanation: \"It is allowed.\" ',\n"," '✅ Trip Verified |   Appalling service with failing defective fleet of A380 aircraft. Flown four times on this route or return and significant delays of 2 to 26 hours every time. BA56 boarded 6:20pm on 13 October. Flight cancelled for technical reasons. Six hours to return through customs and recover bag. No BA management at all at Johannesburg that night. Further four hours to organise a hotel and transfer with queues of 300 people to check in. Room eventually accessed 4:30am No attempt to re-schedule or assist - Pilot trying to announce process.',\n"," '✅ Trip Verified | British Airways charge you for the pleasure of choosing your seat and I had been put at the very back of Club which turned out to be an advantage because it meant I could get to the seat without having to climb over anybody. The seat was clean but as I later discovered that the foldout section would not stay up and your feet dangled over the edge when the bed was extended. After boarding was complete we were told that departure was delayed because BA had not loaded all of the cargo; we were then told that it was delayed further because there was a fault with one of the fuel pumps. It took over five hours for this problem to be corrected as the pilot later informed us that they installed new pump having initially thought that it was a software issue. During that time we were served the meal but were told that alcohol is not permitted which was curious given that we had already been served a pre-departure drink. Most of the cabin crew were male and, apparently, based in Mexico and this turned out to be a pleasant surprise given that those I spoke to were incredibly positive and friendly but seemed embarrassed at what was happening. I knew that it was the old-style seats but what was less acceptable is BA’s petty penny pinching. If there was a competition for the smallest hot towel BA would be the winner. The food sounded nice and looked impressive but seemed totally tasteless.',\n"," \"✅ Trip Verified | What is wrong with you guys? People pay lots of money for a business class ticket but you sit squeezed into a seat with no legroom, nothing is clean, the overhead lockers are empty and they want you to put your bag under the seat so that you have no room for your legs anymore and then serve you food that is just rubbish. The staff demonstrates it's British arrogance with no manners. There is no decent polite service anymore. There is really no difference to easyjet at all. It's the same on their European routes.\",\n"," '✅ Trip Verified |   We booked two business class seat with British Airways in July, 2024 for the flight on September 19, 2024. We were told on September 19 at the Heathrow Airport that our flight was cancelled and we could only have one business seat with another flight to a different airport. No one from the British Airways contacted us to apologize and to offer refund for the business class seat we lost. We filed a complaint to the British Airways and asked for reimbursement on September 21 and have not heard a word from them as of October 11, 2024. It is the worst flight experience we have ever had. Terrible customer service. Zero communication with customers. We cannot even find a phone number to call the British Airways on its website.',\n"," '✅ Trip Verified | I’ve flown with many airlines, but my recent experience with British Airways left much to be desired. The in-flight entertainment was underwhelming, and I was disappointed by the lack of basic amenities, such as a comfort kit with essentials like eye masks. While the only positive aspect was the slightly more generous legroom, overall, I found the service to be far below expectations. Not impressed.',\n"," \"✅ Trip Verified |   I recently flew from New York back to London with BA, this wasn't my first long haul with them however it was my first time travelling in World Traveler Plus. We boarded the aircraft on time and stress free and my first impression was good. The cabin was clean and the leg room was good. The recline on the seat was generous and combined with a footrest it was quite comfortable. Waiting on our seats was a decent quality cushion and blanket as well as an amenity kit. The amenity kit contained some good headphones, socks, an eye mask, lip balm, pen and toothbrush and toothpaste. Once boarding was complete we were offered a pre departure drink with orange juice, water or champagne being the options. The crew were all very friendly and professional and did their upmost to ensure that everyone was happy. Once in the air we were offered a hot towel and another round of drinks, this time with a lot more selection. Drinks were offered several times throughout the flight. A menu was also handed out not long after take off, the starter was quinoa and for main there was a choice of chicken, meatballs and pasta or a vegetarian mushroom dish. I chose the meatballs and they were really good. My only real complaint about the flight was people not getting the dish they wished for. We were sat in the last row of the premium economy cabin and by the time the meal service got to us all of the chicken dishes were gone. The moral of the story is that if you sit at the front of the cabin, you will likely get your preferred meal option. After the meal I chose to watch some shows on the well sized entertainment screen, BA is definitely up there for best inflight entertainment. Finally about an hour before landing we were served a breakfast snack, this come in the form of a warm egg and swiss cheese bagel. It was edible but also a little soggy and didn't really taste of much, I certainly wont be craving one anytime soon. We touched down into Heathrow on time before disembarking the aircraft and picking up our bags, everything was very efficient and we were on our way in no time.\",\n"," 'Not Verified |\\xa0 \\xa0BA business class in Europe has a seat the same as economy, you simply have an empty seat next to you and so for many, the only true benefits are in flight meals, lounge access and priority security etc. The problem on this flight was a small child, aged around five, who sang incessantly in an extremely loud voice throughout most of the flight. I am aware of the difficulties of flying with children, I know it is difficult to keep them entertained etc, I am a patient person, I have headphones. The parents of this child chose, despite a polite request, not to try and quieten their child at all. At this point one had an expectation the crew will step in. If I was singling loudly, disrupting other passengers, they would quite rightly ask me to desist. So why not speak to the parents of a child who is doing the same and disrupting the rest and sleep of other passengers? Instead, having served the meal, the crew retreated behind their curtain and left the passengers to stew. Simply not good enough. As for WiFi? Forget it...',\n"," '✅ Trip Verified | Our flight started in Seattle Wa heading to Lisbon Portugal. After a 10 hour flight and a 2 hour layover we boarded flight BA502 to Lisbon. After heading to the runway the plane stopped and the pilot said we have a small mechanical issue and a mechanic is in route. After an hour in the tarmac the flight crews announce they were going to offer complimentary WATER? Really!! Another half hour goes by and they say the flight is cancelled, no reason at that time. As we wait for a bus to remove all passengers from the plane they announce that there will be staff members back at the gate to help with meal vouchers, taxi rides and hotel accommodations. WHAT? We get off the bus and there is a line of passengers trying to figure out what’s happening. Staff hands my wife and I a $10 meal voucher and says go upstairs and someone will help you with your issues. We go upstairs and nobody knows what to do. One staff member hands us a paper for a hotel room and tells us to get your luggage and keep your receipt for the taxi to be reimbursed. Nothing else. I asked about another flight and she said they will contact you asap. Who will contact?? And she walked away. We grabbed our luggage and headed to the taxi line. As we are being driven to the hotel I receive an email for our flight the next day on a different airline, Iberian? Our assigned seats are not together?? We get to the hotel and I barely fit into the shower and a double bed. I’m 6’3” 230lbs and with my wife. Crazy. Get a little sleep nothing to eat until the am. Another taxi ride to the airport and tried to use our meal vouchers but they were only good for the prior day. Went to the first customer service line and he didn’t have the authorization to issue new vouchers. Finally after the third customer service line we had someone issue us new vouchers. Finally made it to our destination a day in half later and still had to pay for our room that we didn’t even use because of the cancellation.

',\n"," '✅ Trip Verified |   British Airways World Traveller Plus (Premium Economy) product needs some improvement to justify the high cost over economy. Yes, the seat and leg room are far superior and on this flight, the crew were excellent. However, lunch/dinner was only average, wine selection was poor and like some other airlines, BA provides a revolting snack prior to landing. (The same snack is served in economy). Choice of entertainment also requires improvement.
